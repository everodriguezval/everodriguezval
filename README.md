After completing my degree in Biology, I worked for three years in research working with DNA samples in a laboratory. A key part of this role was performing analysis using specialist biological software - it was through this that I discovered my passion for using technology to solve problems.

I completed a self-funded twelve-week intensive Software Development bootcamp course where I learned the fundamentals of Front and Back-end development. Because I have enjoyed this journey very much, I am currently working as a Software Engineer consultant at Xander Talent. 

A proactive dedicated professional, I am excited to take on new challenges and gain experience to grow as a developer! ✨
